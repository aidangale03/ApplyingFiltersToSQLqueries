<h1>Applying Filters to SQL Queries</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of using filters in SQL to filter through large amounts of data. The task is to examine the organizationâ€™s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. I will need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Google Docs</b>
- <b>SQL</b>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables, log_in_attempts and employees. I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.
